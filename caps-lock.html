      <strong>The Designer as Scribe</strong><br><br>
      Tablets were small, often no more than ten centimetres wide. These documents were issued, traded, and therefore owned. Communication as a form of property was contrary to the oral culture of early primitive societies, which was a shared form of communication, as researcher and author Seth Siegelaub notes.<br><br>
      Whether these documents are kept in warehouses or on servers, Lisa Gitelman reminds us that even if these documents are never seen, their primary function is to serve as silent witnesses that can be summoned when needed.<br><br>
      Financial documents are designed to look trustworthy by using style of writing or typography that is consistent, legible, and official.<br><br>
      In early Mesopotamia the destroying of financial records was actually a celebratory event. The New Year festivities in Babylon included 'the breaking of tablets'. An annual ritual to wipe debts clean and literally start with a clean slate.<br><br><br>
      <strong>The Designer as Engineer</strong><br><br>
      Now found on every imaginable product, the bar code was invented by engineer Joe Woodland when he was a graduate student in the US in 1952. Woodland was inspired by Morse code, and as he was sitting on Miami Beach, he drew his fingers in the sand and came up with the idea that the stripes could be thick or thin.<br><br>
      While economic efficiency is undoubtedly the main achievement of the bar code, the collection of consumer data is its most important legacy.<br><br>
      Thanks to Gutenberg's invention, books could now be published in local languages, but not all languages were regarded equally. Those picked for publications depended on where printers were based, and where the centres of power were located.<br><br>
      Official surnames were an  administrative invention. Apart from a few wealthy lords with family lineages, surnames did not exist prior to the seventeenth century.<br><br>
