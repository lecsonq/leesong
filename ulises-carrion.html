            WHAT A BOOK IS<br>
            A book is a sequence of spaces.<br>
            Each of these spaces is perceived at a different moment—a book is also a sequence of moments.<br>
            A book is not a case of words, nor a bag of words, nor a bearer of words.<br>
            A writer, contrary to the popular opinion, does not write books.<br>
            A writer writes texts.<br>
            The fact, that a text is contained in a book, comes only from the dimensions of such a text; or, in the case of a series of short texts (poems, for instance), from their number.<br>
            A literary (prose) text contained in a book ignores the fact that the book is an autonomous space-time sequence.<br>
            A series of more or less short texts (poems or other) distributed through a book following any particular ordering reveals the sequential nature of the book.<br>
            It reveals it, perhaps uses it; but it does not incorporate it or assimilate it.<br>
            Written language is a sequence of signs expanding within the space;
            the reading of which occurs in the time.<br>
            A book is a space-time sequence.<br>
            Books existed originally as containers of (literary) texts.<br>
            But books, seen as autonomous realities, can contain any (written) language, not only literary language, or even any other system of signs.<br>
            Among languages, literary language (prose and poetry) is not the best fitted to the nature of books.<br>
            A book may be the accidental container of a text, the structure of which is irrelevant to the book: these are the books of bookshops and libraries.<br>
            A book can also exist as an autonomous and self-sufficient form, including perhaps a text that emphasizes that form, a text that is an organic part of that form: here begins the new art of making books.<br>
            In the old art the writer judges himself as being not responsible for thereal book. He writes the text.<br>
            The rest is done by the servants, the artisans, the workers, the others.<br>
            In the new art writing a text is only the first link in the chain going from the writer to the reader. In the new art the writer assumes the responsibility for the whole process.<br>
            In the old art the writer writes texts.<br>
            In the new art the writer makes books.<br>
            To make a book is to actualize its ideal space-time sequence by means of the creation of a parallel sequence of signs, be it linguistic or other.<br>
